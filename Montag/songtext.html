<h1>Deep Purple: Smoke On The Water</h1>

<p>
We all came out to Montreux<br>
On the Lake Geneva shoreline<br>
To make records with a mobile<br>
We didn't have much time<br>
Frank Zappa and the Mothers<br>
Were at the best place around<br>
But some stupid with a flare gun<br>
Burned the place to the ground<br>
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
</p>
<p>
They burned down the gambling house<br>
It died with an awful sound<br>
Funky Claude was running in and out<br>
Pulling kids out the ground<br>
When it all was over<br>
We had to find another place<br>
But Swiss time was running out<br>
It seemed that we would lose the race<br>
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
</p>
<p>
We ended up at the Grand Hotel<br>
It was empty cold and bare<br>
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside<br>
Making our music there<br>
With a few red lights and a few old beds<br>
We make a place to sweat<br>
No matter what we get out of this<br>
I know we'll never forget<br>
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
